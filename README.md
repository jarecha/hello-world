Understanding the gist of things.

I'm an industrial designer looking for a way to form a part of the next industrial revolution.
Programming isn't my forte, I hardly know anything about coding. But I'm determined.
I am fully passionate of harnessing technology's power for the greater benefit of society.
The concept of open-source projects excites me because I believe in collaboration and teamwork.
Here's hoping I can create projects on GitHub to share with others and learn.
